# ⚙️ Hardware Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **ESP32** | The main microcontroller unit responsible for sensor data processing, decision making, and IoT communication through Wi-Fi. |
| **MQ-2 Gas Sensor** | Detects the presence of LPG, methane, or propane in the environment and outputs an analog signal proportional to the gas concentration. |
| **Relay Module** | Acts as a switch to disconnect or trip the power supply in case of leakage. |
| **L298N Motor Driver** | Controls the operation of the exhaust fan and servo motor. |
| **Servo Motor** | Automatically closes the gas valve when leakage is detected. |
| **Exhaust Fan** | Removes leaked gas from the surroundings to prevent ignition. |
| **Buzzer** | Provides an audible alarm during gas leakage. |
| **Power Supply** | Provides regulated 5V DC power for the ESP32 and connected peripherals. |

The hardware components are selected for cost efficiency, reliability, and ease of integration in IoT applications.
